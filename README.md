## Project Overview

This project is a **real-time IoT-based Weather Monitoring Station** built using the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi board, featuring a web dashboard accessible over your local network. The station collects environmental data such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, and air quality using common sensors. All readings are displayed live on a modern web dashboard, offering both raw values and graphical trends.

## Sensor Pin Mapping

**Refer to this table to correctly wire your sensors:**

| Sensor Pinout       | Arduino UNO R4 Pin                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **DHT11**           | Signal: Pin 2, VCC: 5V, GND: GND  |
| **BMP180**          | SDA: A4, SCL: A5, VCC: 3.3V/5V, GND: GND |
| **MQ135**           | AO: A0, VCC: 5V, GND: GND         |
| **Rain Sensor**     | AO: A1, VCC: 5V, GND: GND         |

## How It Works

1. **Sensors collect weather data:**  
   - Temperature and humidity from DHT11  
   - Atmospheric pressure from BMP180  
   - Air quality from MQ135  
   - Rain detection from rain sensor

2. **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi reads all sensor data** and serves it via HTTP over WiFi.

3. **Web dashboard:**  
   - Accessed on any device connected to the same WiFi network.
   - Built-in AJAX updates and real-time charting (using Chart.js).
   - Displays both current and historical sensor readings.

4. **No cloud needed:**  
   - All data stays local; no third-party services.

## How To Build

### 1. Hardware Assembly

- Carefully connect each sensor according to the diagrams above.
- Supply the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi with the appropriate power.
- Double-check all connections against the [Circuit Diagram](#circuit-diagram).

### 2. Software Setup

- Install necessary Arduino libraries:
  - Adafruit BMP085 Library
  - DHT Sensor Library
  - Arduino_LED_Matrix
  - WiFiS3 (for R4 WiFi networking)
- Flash the provided `.ino` file (`IOT_WeatherStation.ino`) to your board.
- Open the Serial Monitor to see status messages.

### 3. Accessing the Dashboard

- Connect your computer/smartphone to the same WiFi network as the Arduino.
- The Arduino will print its IP address to the Serial Monitor upon boot.
- Enter the IP (e.g. `http://192.168.0.101/`) into any browser to view your local IoT Weather Dashboard.
